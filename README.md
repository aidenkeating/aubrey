## Overview
An extremely dodgy script for generating `.nsprc` 
files for a project while the vulnerabilities are being 
resolved to allow for complete visibility for everyone trying 
to use the project.

## How to use

* Clone the project

* Move directory to the file

* Run `sudo npm link`

* You should now be able to run `aubrey` in any directory
